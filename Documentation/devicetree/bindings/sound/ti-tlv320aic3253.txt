* TI TLV320AIC3253

The TLV320AIC3253 is a flexible, low-power, low-voltage stereo audio codec
with programmable outputs, fully-programmable miniDSP, fixed predefined and
parameterizable signal processing blocks, integrated PLL, integrated LDO and
flexible digital interfaces, it is connected to the host processor via i2c for
commands and have various GPIOs connected to control reset, mclk selection.

Required properties:
 - compatible:
		the string of "ti,aic3253"
 - reg:
		the i2c slave address of the IC
 - gpios:
		an array specifiying the two required GPIOs for operation. They must
		be specified in exact order:
			- RESET GPIO
			- MCLK - the mclk selection gpio

Example:

	/* GSBI10 - I2C */
	&i2c10 {
		/* TI tlv320aic3253 */
		aic3253@18 {
			compatible = "ti,aic3253";
			reg = <0x18>;
			gpios = <&pm8921_gpio 18 0>, /* RESET */
				<&pm8921_gpio 8 0>;  /* MCLK  */
		};
	};
