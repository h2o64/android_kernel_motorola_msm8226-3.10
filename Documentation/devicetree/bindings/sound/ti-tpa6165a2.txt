* TI TPA6165A2

TPA6165A2 is a headset interface IC with a high-performance, low-power
DirectPath variable-attenuation Class-G stereo headphone amplifier,
variable=gain microphone pre-amplifier with bias, and advanced accessory
detection circuitry.

Required properties:
	- compatible:
		the string of "ti,tpa6165"
	- reg:
		the i2c slave address of the IC
	- interrupts:
		there is one interrupt line connected to the main SoC
	- interrupt-parent:
		The parent interrupt controller
	- gpios:
		an array specifiying the required GPIO for operation
			- IRQ GPIO
Optional properties:
	- ti,tpa6165-always-on-micbias:
		this property indicates that mic bias is always turned ON when
		headset is plugged in. This should be set by products which has
		low power dsp support for always on voice recognition and continous
		noise estimates.
	- ti,tpa6165-jack-detect-config:
		this property allow to set custom default value for the jack
		detection test hardware settings register (0x18).
		The value bits are :
		BIT 7 - Maximum Impedance During Short
			Defines maximum impedance below which pin is considered
			short.This information is used while detecting whether
			PIN2_ROUT is ground.
			0 = 4 立
			1 = 7 立
		BIT 6 - Threshold Impedance to Distinguish Between Headphone and
			Lineout Load.Defines impedance below which load is Headphone
			and above is Lineout.
			0 = 700 立
			1 = 1.5 k立
		BITS 5-0 - Reserved
Example:

	i2c@1a200000 {
		status = "okay";

		qcom,i2c-bus-freq = <400000>;
		qcom,i2c-src-freq = <24000000>;

		tpa6165xx@40 {
			compatible = "ti,tpa6165";
			reg = <0x40>;
			interrupt-parent = <&pm8921_gpio>;
			interrupts = <38 0>;
			gpios = <&pm8921_gpio 38 0>;     /* IRQ */
			ti,tpa6165-always-on-micbias = <1>;
			ti,tpa6165-jack-detect-config = <0xC0>;
		};
	};
