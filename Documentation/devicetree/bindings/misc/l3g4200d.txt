l3g4200d Gyro sensor

The L3G4200D is a low-power three-axis angular
rate sensor able to provide unprecedented
stablility of zero rate level and sensitivity over
temperature and time. It includes a sensing
element and an IC interface capable of providing
the measured angular rate to the external world
through a digital interface (I2C/SPI).

Required properties:
	- compatible:	Must be "stm,l3g4200d"
	- reg:		Specifies the I2C address of the part.
	- poll-interval:polling interval in ms.
	- gpios:
			an array specifiying the three required GPIOs for operation.
	Optional Properties:
	- vdd-supply:;       regulator suppy to VDD.

	Example:

		l3g4200d@6A {
			compatible = "stm,l3g4200d";
			reg = <0x6A>;
			vdd-supply = <&pm8226_l19>;
			stm,poll-interval = <200>;
			gpios = <&msmgpio 64 0>; /* DRDY/INT2 */
		};
