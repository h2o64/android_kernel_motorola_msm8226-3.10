AK8963C Magnetometer

AK8963C is a 3-axis electronic compass to measure earths geomagnetism
to determine azimuth.
It is connected to the host processor on the I2C interface.

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "akm,akm8963"
- reg:			Specifies the I2C address of the part.
- interrupt-parent:	The parent interrupt controller
- interrupts:		Interrupt line connected to the main SoC
- akm,gpio-irq:		IRQ GPIO
- akm,layout:		physical orientation layout of sensor.
- akm,outbit:		set number of data bits reported by the sensor.

Optional Properties:
- akm,gpio-rst:		RESET GPIO
- akm8963_vdd-supply:	regulator suppy to VDD

Example:

	ak8963@0c {
		compatible = "akm,akm8963";
		reg = <0x0c>;
		akm8963_vdd-supply = <&pm8226_l19>;
		interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
		interrupts = <66 0x2>;
		akm,gpio-irq = <&msmgpio 66 0>;
		akm,gpio-rst = <&msmgpio 62 0>;
		akm,layout = <1>;
		akm,outbit = <1>;
	};
