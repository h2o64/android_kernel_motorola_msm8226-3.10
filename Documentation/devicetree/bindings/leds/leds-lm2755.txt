MMI lm2755 Leds

MMI lm2755 LEDs driver is used for controlling LEDs
driven by TI LM2755 Controller. The IC is connected
to Host processor via I2C bus. This driver supports single
color LED linux devices and RGB tricolor device with configu-
rable blink profile. RGB interface provides combined control
for LEDs on D1, D2 and D3 outputs.

Required properties:
- compatible		: should be "lm,lm2755"
- reg			: I2C address two possible configurations:
			: 0x18 if ADDR pin is grounded
			: 0x67 if ADDR pin is tied high
- clock-mode		: clock mode 0x0 for internal, 0x40 for external clock
- charge-pump-mode	: charge pump mode parameter should be 0x0 or 0x80. In mode 0x80 waveform can
			: be enabled before the charge pump. With mode 0x0 charge pump is powered on
			: before waveform generator
- min-tstep		: Sets N for timing control equations. Valid range from 0 to 7. Defines Tstep:
			: For internal clock Tstep = 50us*2^N
			: For external clock Tstep = 2^N*(32 + Fext)
- max-level 		: max brightness level. LM2755 has 32 brightness levels. Max 0x1F.
			: At least one of the three led outputs has to be configured:
- d1-led-name 		: linux name for led connected to D1 output. No property means output is not used.
- d2-led-name 		: linux name for led connected to D2 output. No property means output is not used.
- d3-led-name 		: linux name for led connected to D3 output. No property means output is not used.

Optional properties for RGB device:
- rgb-class-name	: Linux led class name for the combined rgb device. Default "rgb".
