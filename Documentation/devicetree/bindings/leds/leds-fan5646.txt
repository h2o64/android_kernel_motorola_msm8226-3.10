MMI fan5646 Leds

MMI fan5646 LEDs driver is used for controlling LEDs
driven by FSI FAN5646 Controller. The IC is connected
to host processor via dedicated GPIO line.
TinyWire protocol is used to communicate with the chip.

Required properties:
- compatible		: should be "fsi,leds-fan5646"
- gpios			: gpio cell to describe pin used to control the IC
- tsleep		: bit duration for TinyWire protocol in us. Max 40us, Min 500 ns.
- full-current		: full-scale LED current setting for Iset bits in control register
			: CONTROL[6:7]:
			: 0 - 5 mA, 1 - 10 mA, 2 - 15 mA, 3 - 20 mA
			: This assumed that Rset resistor is not used as well.
			: Which is always true for for WLCSP packages.
- fan5646-supply	: Phandle of the supply node used to power the IC.
- linux-name 		: Linux led class device name for led connected to the IC.
- rgb-class-name	: Linux led class name for the rgb device.
