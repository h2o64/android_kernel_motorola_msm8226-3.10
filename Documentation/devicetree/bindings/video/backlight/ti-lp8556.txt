Texas Instrument LP8556 Backlight Controller

Required Properties:
 - compatible:
        should be set to "ti,lp8556"
 - reg:
        the i2c slave address of the IC
 - gpios:
        entry specifying the enable pin (EN_VDDIO) of the IC.

Optional Properties:
 - vddio-supply:
        phandle to the IC's regulator supply for VDD if required
 - ti,lp8556-initial-brightness:
        power up brightness to set during first initialization. If not
        supplied it will be set to 0x00. This value is programmed to
        the BRT_CTRL_REG (0x00) register.
 - ti,lp8556-dev-ctrl-config:
        initial setting for device control register.  If it is not
        supplied 0x00 will be used. This value is programmed to the
        DEVICE_CTRL_REG (0x01) register.
 - ti,lp8556-direct-ctrl:
        initial setting for the direct control register.  If it is not
        supplied 0x00 will be programmed.  The value is programmed into
        the DIRECT_CTRL_REG (0x04) register.
 - ti,lp8556-eeprom-settings:
        initial firmware control register array.  This is an array of
        register address and value pairs to be progammed into the EEPROM
        register space [registers 0x98 to 0xaf].  They should be of the
        format of: <addr> <value>.

Example:

lp8556@2c {
	compatible = "ti,lp8556";
	reg = <0x2c>;
	gpios = <&msmgpio 52 0>;  /* enable GPIO */

	ti,lp8556-initial-brightness = <0x3a>;
	ti,lp8556-dev-ctrl-config = <0x84>;
	ti,lp8556-eeprom-settings = <0x9e 0x02
				     0xa5 0x3c
				     0xa6 0x40
				     0xa7 0xfc>;
};
