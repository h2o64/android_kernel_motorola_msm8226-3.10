Texas Instrument LM3630A Backlight Controller

Required Properties:
 - compatible:
        Should be set to "ti,lm3630a"
 - reg:
        The i2c slave address of the IC

Optional Properties:
 - ti,vddio-name:
        Regulator supply name for the IC's VDD if required
 - ti,irq-gpio:
        Interrupt gpio pin for the IC's INTN if required
 - ti,hwen-gpio:
        Hardware enable pin for the IC's HWEN if required
 - ti,pwm-gpio:
        PWM gpio pin for the IC's PWM control if required
 - ti,leda-ctrl:
        The settings are related to LEDA enable/disable and output
        mode, which will be programmed to REG_CTRL (0x00) bit 2 and
        bit 4.
 - ti,ledb-ctrl:
        The settings are related to LEDB enable/disable and output
        mode, which will be programmed to REG_CTRL (0x00) bit 0,
        bit 1 and bit 3.
 - ti,boost-ctrl:
        The settings are related to over-voltage, over-current and
        boost frequency etc, which will be programed to REG_BOOST
        (0x02).
 - ti,pwm-ctrl:
        The PWM settings to enable/disable and active level, and
        will be programed to REG_CONFIG (0x01) 3 lowest bits.
 - ti,leda-init-brt:
        LEDA power up brightness to set during first initialization.
        If not supplied it will be set to 0xFF. This value is
        programmed to the REG_BRT_A (0x03) register.
 - ti,ledb-init-brt:
        LEDB power up brightness to set during first initialization.
        If not supplied it will be set to 0xFF. This value is
        programmed to the REG_BRT_B (0x04) register.
 - ti,leda-max-brt:
        Maximum allowable brightness value to program to REG_BRT_A
        (0x03). If not supplied 0xFF will be used.
 - ti,ledb-max-brt:
        Maximum allowable brightness value to program to REG_BRT_B
        (0x04). If not supplied 0xFF will be used.
 - ti,leda-max-cur:
        Maximum allowable current value while setting backlight
        brightness value as 0xFF. It will be programmed to REG_I_A
        (0x05) 5 lowest bits.
 - ti,ledb-max-cur:
        Maximum allowable current value while setting backlight
        brightness value as 0xFF. It will be programmed to REG_I_B
        (0x06) 5 lowest bits.

Example:
	lm3630a@38 {
		status = "okay";
		compatible = "ti,lm3630a";
		reg = <0x38>;

		/* 2 string LEDs controled by LEDA */
		ti,leda-ctrl = <0x14>;
		ti,ledb-ctrl = <0x01>;
		ti,leda-max-brt = <0xff>;
		ti,ledb-max-brt = <0xff>;
		ti,leda-init-brt = <0xf0>;
		ti,ledb-init-brt = <0xf0>;
		ti,leda-max-cur = <0x19>;
		ti,ledb-max-cur = <0x19>;
		ti,boost-ctrl = <0x20>;
		ti,pwm-ctrl = <0x00>;
		ti,irq-gpio = <&msmgpio 4 0>;
		ti,hwen-gpio = <&msmgpio 5 0>;
		ti,vddio-name = "vddio_bl";
		vddio_bl-supply = <&pm8226_l6>;
	};
